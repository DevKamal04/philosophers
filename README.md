The "Philosophers" project at 42 school is an exercise in multi-threading/multi-processing programming using mutexes and semaphores, inspired by the famous Dining Philosophers problem. 

Project Rules:

The project must be coded in C, following the 42 Norm. Any memory leaks, crashes, undefined behavior, or norm errors will result in a score of 0.

Philosophers sit around a circular table and can only do one of three things: eating, thinking, or sleeping.

To eat, philosophers need two forks (one in each hand).

Philosophers must never starve and must eat periodically.

Philosophers don't communicate with each other.

Philosophers don't know when another philosopher is about to die.

After eating, a philosopher will drop the forks and start sleeping.

After sleeping, a philosopher will start thinking.

The simulation stops when a philosopher dies.

Each program should have the following options: number_of_philosophers, time_to_die, time_to_eat, time_to_sleep, 
[number_of_times_each_philosopher_must_eat].

Philosophers should avoid dying!
